![C# Logo](/images/CSharp.png)

I want to share with you  some C# Extensions that I have used sometime in my projects.

I hope that helps.

The source code has two projects:

A project with the Extensions in C#, and a demo project to show you the use of all them.

## Extension Methods List

### **ExceptionExtensions**
**`GetMessagesFromInnerExceptions`** - Returns an *StringBuilder* object with the *Exception* object and the *InnerException* object's information when the *Exception* has one or more *InnerException* objects inside.

### **StringExtensions** 
**`Repeat`** - Returns a character repeated a number of times.
